<h2>General Information</h2>

<!--
  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->

<div class="jumbotron">
<p>
<a href=http://datacarpentry.org>Data Carpentry</a> workshops are for any researcher or
professional who has data they want to analyze, and who wants to learn more about
tools and techniques for working with data.
</p>

<p>
This hands-on workshop will cover how to work more effectively with data and
an introduction to programming in R. By the end of the workshop,
participants should be able to load data, conduct simple analyses, and produce
basic visualizations. They will also be aware of best practices for data
management to enable reproducibility.
</p>

<p>
No prior computational experience is required.  Participants should bring their laptops and plan to participate actively.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>
To participate in a Data Carpentry workshop, you will need working copies of the
described software. Please make sure to install everything (or at least to download
the installers) before the start of your workshop. Participants should bring and use
their own laptops to insure the proper setup of tools for an efficient workflow
once you leave the workshop.
<p>
Please follow these <a href=install.html>Setup Instructions</a>.

<p>
  We maintain a list of common issues that occur during installation as a reference for instructors
  that may be useful on the
  <a href = "https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions">Configuration Problems and Solutions wiki page</a>.

  SYLLABUS

  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.
